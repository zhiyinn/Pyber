From the Bubble Plot, we find that the number of rides and Pyber drivers both are more prevalent in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities though the average fare trends higher in suburban and rural cities in select cases. This is consistent with what we see in other visualizations of the data. For instance, in all three Pie Charts, the bulk of total fare, total rides and total drivers are found in urban cities. We also note that prices for rides are high in rural and suburban areas. 
From this information, we can infer that that there are opportunities to expand the Pyber business in suburban and rural cities, in terms of hiring more drivers to operate and lowering costs for consumers in these areas.
